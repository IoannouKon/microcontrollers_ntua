# microcontrollers_ntua
Welcome to microcontollers repository for for the NTUA University's course during the academic year 2022-2023.this repository serves as a introduction to microcontrollers using 8085 simulator and MPLAB® X IDE.

## Overview

This repository encompasses a range of topics covered in the microcontroller courses at ECE NTUA, including:

1. **microcontroller Systems**:Introduction to 8085 assembly ,testing with 8085 simulator. [click here](./microcontrollers_Systems)
2. **microcontrollers LAB**:Introduction examples (imers, interrupts, pwm, LCD screen, keyboard, temperature measurement with a sensor, sound production via buzzer, communication with UART) for AVR microcontroller using MPLAB® X IDE and ntua_board .

Exercises and laboratory on microcomputers in assembly and C languages ​​with 8085 microcomputers and AVR.
Here are the recitations and solutions for the courses Microcomputer Systems and Microcomputer Laboratory of the academic year 2022-2023 for NTUA university.
Examples are mentioned for timers, interrupts, pwm, LCD screen, keyboard, temperature measurement with a sensor, sound production via buzzer, communication with UART.
For all of the above there are codes in C language but also in assemble as well as reports with an explanation of them.
All the above was done on the board of the ntuaboard laboratory (mlab).
